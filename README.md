# SevenTitles
Uses the *YouTube timedtext API* and slight *DOM reading* to save `auto-generated` captions (en).  <br> Displays the toggled member(s) corresponding image and sound effect whenever/if the captions say their name.

## Small Warning
**You may see subtitles turn themselves on and flicker when you open a new video, this is expected behaviour as the extension has to make YouTube fetch the caption data to intercept it. *This feature will be made toggleable in the future.***

 Subtitle fetch code and other partial snippets were made with the help of my friend who didn't want to be credited, but here it is anyway :evil:
